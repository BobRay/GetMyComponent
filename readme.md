GetMyComponent creates the files for the MyComponent package, a generic build script for MODx Revolution components.
Since MyComponent is itself a build script, it can't be installed through Package Manager. Once you have
installed GetMyComponent, the MyComponent files will be in place at assets/mycomponents/mycomponent/.

From that point on, the GetMyComponent package should be ignored. Note that if you uninstall
or remove it, all the files of MyComponent will be removed.
